# Notebook \#6
Deep learning with MLP and CNN for an image recognition task. 

## The Data: ðŸ“Š

For this notebook, you will train two deep neural networks: 1) a multilayer perceptron (MLP), and 2) a convolutional neural network (CNN) for an image recognition task (like the cat vs. dog example). In this case, your algorithm will utilize a dataset of images to help learn useful features to classify an image into one of 10 classes. You should be using the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

The starter notebook contains a snippet of code on how to download the dataset using PyTorch's __torchvision.datasets__ module

## The Exercises: ðŸ’ª
The assignment is to run an experiment where you try a simple MLP network and a CNN to see which network gives you the best result (in terms of classification accuracy metric). I will be looking for the following:

- In a mark-down cell near the top of your notebook, give a brief explanation of your problem.  
- Build an **MLP** that has this structure (the exact number of parameters is given in the starter notebook as suggestions):
  - One input layer 
  - Three hidden layers
  - One output layer
- Build a **CNN** that has this structure (the exact number of parameters is given in the starter notebook as suggestions):
  - Conv layer 1
  - Conv layer 2
  - Flatten layer
  - Fully Connected layer (Dense)
  - Fully Connected layer (Dense)

- Train both models and compare their performance.    
    - You should train each model for enough epochs that your performance on the test set stops improving (i.e., show where you reach overfitting)  OR for at least 1 hour of training time. If you would like to further experiment with additional changes, that is fine, but because these things sometimes take a long time to train.

- **Include graphs** of how well your testing data performed vs. the training data.
- **Conclusions**: Answer the following questions in a markup cell at the bottom of your notebook.
    - What configuration of your DNN (MLP or CNN) proved to be more accurate? Why do you think this is the case?
    - How accurate can you make your CNN predictor? 

Use a Markup cell to put your name at the top of the file. Rename your file LastnameNotebook6.ipynb and submit the link to your repository to Blackboard.

## :white_check_mark: Grading: 
I will update the following rubric with your grade after you have completed the assignment.
