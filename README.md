# Notebook \#6
Deep learning with MLP and CNN for an image recognition task. 

## The Data: ðŸ“Š

For this notebook, you will train two deep neural networks: 1) a multilayer perceptron (MLP), and 2) a convolutional neural network (CNN) for an image recognition task (like the cat vs. dog example). In this case, your algorithm will utilize a dataset of images to help learn useful features to classify an image into one of 10 classes. You should be using the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

The starter notebook contains a snippet of code on how to download the dataset using PyTorch's __torchvision.datasets__ module

## The Exercises: ðŸ’ª
The assignment is to run an experiment where you try a basic CNN network and then try a variation on it to see what happens. I will be looking for the following:

1. In a mark-down cell near the top of your notebook, give a brief explanation of your problem.  
2. Build a **baseline CNN** that has this structure:
  - Conv layer 1
  - Pool layer 1
  - Conv layer 2
  - Pool layer 2
  - Flatten
  - Fully Connected (Dense)

3. Build a **tuned CNN**--simply a CNN that has some changes from the first one. You may change whichever parameters you like (consider the kernel size, the number of layers, the types of layers, the number of feature maps in each layer, adding dropout layers, etc). Just make some sort of change that you think might be significant, train you new model, and compare its performance to the original. In a text-cell, describe what you changed.   
    - You should train each model for enough epochs that your performance on the test set stops improving (i.e., show where you reach overfitting)  OR for at least 30 minutes of training time. If you would like to further experiment with additional changes, that is fine, but because these things sometimes take a long time to train, I'm setting a low bar for just showing me two variations.

4. **Include graphs** of how well your testing data performed vs. the training data.

5. **Conclusions**: Answer the following questions in a markup cell at the bottom of your notebook.
    - What configuration of your CNN proved to be more accurate? Why do you think this is the case?
    - How accurate can you make your CNN predictor? I will award a bonus point to the student who can achieve the most accurate model.

Use a Markup cell to put your name at the top of the file. Rename your file LastnameNotebook6.ipynb and submit the link to your repository to Blackboard.
